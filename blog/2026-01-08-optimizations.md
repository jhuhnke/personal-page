I’m calling this year **the year of optimizations**.

Not in the productivity-hustle sense, and not as a rigid self-improvement overhaul. More like a series of small, deliberate experiments, one per month, aimed at improving different areas of my life and health.

The rules for the year of optimizations are simple:

- Try one focused change for a month  
- Measure how well it actually goes
- If it works, it stays and if it doesn't, it goes

## Why I’m doing this

Like a lot of software developers, I spend most of my days with my butt glued to a chair.

Long hours sitting. Deep focus. Context switching. Coffee as a baseline requirement. Snacks that appear during late-night debugging sessions. Alcohol as a social decompressor. All this bad stuff adds up. 

I feel both physically and mentally fine now, but will I in several years? Who knows. It's often easier to make changes before they are needed rather than when you are forced to. 

Instead of making a huge, vague goal for the new year's (i.e. “be healthier”), I’m running smaller, scoped experiments each month.

## January: cutting stimulants and sugar

January’s experiment was intentionally simple:

- **No sweets or desserts**
- **No alcohol**
- **No caffeine after 10 AM**

No calorie tracking. No macro optimization. Just removing a few high-calorie and low nutrient items and seeing what happens.

### What I’ve noticed so far

- I’m **down ~3 lbs**, without other efforts to lose weight
- No sleepiness post lunch, but I crave bubbly drinks 
- My Garmin says my resting heart rate while asleep has slightly decreased 

To be honest, I'm realizing I don't actually like desserts that much. It is a bummer not to be able to have a beer during Indiana football's historic playoff run though. 

So far, this experiment will likely stay in the **keep** pile except for the occasional craft beer. At a brewery, after I did something to earn it.

## February: sleep optimization (TBD)

February’s experiment isn’t fully defined yet, but it’s centered around **sleep**.

Some ideas I’m considering:

- No screens after a certain hour
- White noise 
- Sleeping in a cooler room
- Weighted blankets and eye rests

I still need to do some research here as what could be the highest impact item. It could be one of these, none of these or all of them.

## The bigger idea

This isn’t about becoming perfectly optimized.

It’s about treating life changes that may suck a bit more like a system:

- Observe
- Change one variable
- Measure the outcome
- Keep what compounds

I’ll write occasional updates as the year goes on, partly for accountability and partly as notes to future-me. If nothing else, it’ll be interesting to look back and see which changes actually stuck.
